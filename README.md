Learning any new skill is difficult and learning to code is more so because of confusing set of options & faster evolutions of technology in the last decade. 

There are so many options that it confuses and distracts us at the same time. 
- Which launguage to learn?
- Which framework is better & whether it makes sense to commit to one framework? 
- Which API layer is better- REST vs GraphQL?
- Which data fetching library to use?
- Should we store data in cache or session or server?
- When should I use a state management library?
- Is redux worth the hype?
- In which sequence should I learn them?


There are so many tutorials, blogs, courses, videos that we end up looping in a spiral of content without actually learning anything that sticks.

I have also gone through all the above doubts & challenges of learning in the last one year and persisted my way to finally learning following technologies:
- JavaScript (beginner to advanced)
- Graphql API 
- Apollo Client 
- React
- React Native
- Redux
- Expo

It will be unfair to say that I am an expert. Far from it, I am still learning. But I would like to belive I have passed the major hurdles of learning all beginners go through and I want to share my knowledge and guide you so that learning coding or acquiring any new skills becomes an easier tasks for you all.
